# SudokuSolver
A CPP Program that gives a solution for a Sudoku puzzle.

## Running the program
```
g++ sudoku.cpp
[./a.out (Linux) | a (Windows CMD)]
```

Note that if there's no solution to the Puzzle, the sudoku board will be displayed the same as that of the input (i.e., with empty spaces as dots).
